### 1.Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.7.1.

### 2.Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 and OECD average income data to better understand:

Which is the best country from OECD members for SW developers to earn good money?
How does company size affect SW developer salary by OECD countries?
Is education level important to make good money for SW developer in OECD countries?

### 3.File Descriptions
There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. the notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

### 4.Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

### 5.Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Stack Overflow and OECD for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Stack Overflow link available here<https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/>  and OECD link available here<http://www.oecd.org/termsandconditions/>.
